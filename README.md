## Quickstart

> **⚠️ Notice**  
> Pull requests are disabled for this repository. For support and questions, please contact our team directly.

### API Token Generation

To get started with the Producerflow API, you'll need to generate an API token:

1. Log into your Producerflow account.
2. Navigate to API Keys in your account settings.
3. Generate a new API key with appropriate expiration date.
4. Securely store your API key for use in API requests.

For detailed API documentation and examples, visit our [comprehensive API documentation](docs/).

## Installation & Usage

### Using Protocol Buffer Files

The raw `.proto` files are located in the `producerflow/` directory and can be used to generate clients for any language supported by Protocol Buffers.

```bash
# Install buf and necessary plugins for your target language
# Then generate clients using the proto files
buf generate
```

### Using Pre-Generated Clients

#### Go Client

```bash
go get github.com/agentero/producerflowapi/gen/go
```

#### TypeScript Client

```bash
npm install @agentero/producerflowapi
```

For detailed installation and usage instructions, see the respective client library documentation.

## Client Libraries

### Generated Client Directories

- **[Go Client Library](/gen/go/)** - Complete Go implementation with gRPC and Connect support
- **[TypeScript Client Library](/gen/ts/)** - Full TypeScript/JavaScript client with type definitions

### Supported Languages

The monorepo currently provides official support for:

- **Go** (1.21+)
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (Node.js 18+)

For other languages, use the Protocol Buffer definitions in `producerflow/` with the official Protocol Buffer compiler and language-specific plugins. Refer to the [Buf documentation](https://buf.build/docs) for comprehensive language support.

### Navigation Guide

- **API Definitions**: Start with `producerflow/producer/v1/producer.proto`
- **Go Integration**: Use code in `gen/go/` directory
- **TypeScript Integration**: Use code in `gen/ts/` directory
- **Documentation**: Reference `docs/` for detailed API guides

## Build/Generation Instructions

### Generating Official Clients

To regenerate the Go and TypeScript clients within the monorepo:

```bash
# From the repository root
buf generate
```

This command will:

1. Validate all Protocol Buffer definitions
2. Generate Go client code in `gen/go/`
3. Generate TypeScript client code in `gen/ts/`

### Prerequisites

- [Buf CLI](https://buf.build/docs/installation) installed
- Go 1.21+ (for Go generation)
- Node.js 18+ (for TypeScript generation)

### Custom Generation for Other Languages

For languages not officially supported by this monorepo, refer to the [Buf documentation](https://buf.build/docs) for comprehensive code generation guides and plugin configurations.
