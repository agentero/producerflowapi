<a name="producerflow-appointment-v1-AppointmentService"></a>

### AppointmentService
AppointmentService manages license appointments through NIPR.

The appointment flow in NIPR is as follows:
1. A new appointment (or termination) is requested for a license number.
2. Some time later, NIPR processes the request and returns the final result.

Since NIPR does not return results immediately, RequestAppointment and TerminateAppointment
RPCs will return a processing status of IN_PROGRESS if the request is accepted by NIPR.
When the appointment is finally processed by NIPR, ProducerFlow will notify via a webhook of
the final result. Also, any call from this point on to ListAppointments or GetAppointment will
also return the final result.

Any call to this service must be authenticated using an API key in the request headers. The API key
can be found in the ProducerFlow API key section of the ProducerFlow UI and it identifies the tenant
that is making the request.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| GetAppointment | [GetAppointmentRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetAppointmentRequest) | [GetAppointmentResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetAppointmentResponse) | Retrieves the details of an appointment by its ID. |
| GetAppointmentFees | [GetAppointmentFeesRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetAppointmentFeesRequest) | [GetAppointmentFeesResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetAppointmentFeesResponse) | Retrieves the total fees associated with requesting an appointment. Fee amounts are represented as integer values in cents. E.g. $10.34 is sent as 1034. |
| GetCarriers | [GetCarriersRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetCarriersRequest) | [GetCarriersResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetCarriersResponse) | Retrieves the carriers that are available to appoint licenses for the tenant. |
| GetTerminationFees | [GetTerminationFeesRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetTerminationFeesRequest) | [GetTerminationFeesResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-GetTerminationFeesResponse) | Retrieves the total fees associated with terminating an appointment. Fee amounts are represented as integer values in cents. E.g. $10.34 is sent as 1034. |
| ListAppointments | [ListAppointmentsRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-ListAppointmentsRequest) | [ListAppointmentsResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-ListAppointmentsResponse) | Lists appointments for the tenant, optionally filtered by processing status. |
| ListEligibleLicenses | [ListEligibleLicensesRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-ListEligibleLicensesRequest) | [ListEligibleLicensesResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-ListEligibleLicensesResponse) | Returns a list of licenses that are eligible to be appointed. |
| RequestAppointment | [RequestAppointmentRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-RequestAppointmentRequest) | [RequestAppointmentResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-RequestAppointmentResponse) | Requests a new appointment for a license that is eligible to be appointed. The simpler way to do this is to call ListEligibleLicenses to get a list of licenses that are eligible to be appointed. Then, call RequestAppointment for the licenses in the list that you want to appoint.

If the request is accepted by NIPR, the appointment will have IN_PROGRESS processing status. If rejected, it will have REJECTED status and reasons will be provided in not_eligible_reasons. |
| TerminateAppointment | [TerminateAppointmentRequest](#producerflow-appointment-v1-TerminateAppointmentRequest) | [TerminateAppointmentResponse](#producerflow-appointment-v1-TerminateAppointmentResponse) | Terminates an existing appointment by ID, providing a reason. |

## Scalar Value Types

| .proto Type | Notes | C++ | Java | Python | Go | C# | PHP | Ruby |
| ----------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ------ | -- | -- | --- | ---- |
| <a name="double" /> double |  | double | double | float | float64 | double | float | Float |
| <a name="float" /> float |  | float | float | float | float32 | float | float | Float |
| <a name="int32" /> int32 | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint32 instead. | int32 | int | int | int32 | int | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="int64" /> int64 | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint64 instead. | int64 | long | int/long | int64 | long | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="uint32" /> uint32 | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint32 | int | int/long | uint32 | uint | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="uint64" /> uint64 | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint64 | long | int/long | uint64 | ulong | integer/string | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="sint32" /> sint32 | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int32s. | int32 | int | int | int32 | int | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="sint64" /> sint64 | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int64s. | int64 | long | int/long | int64 | long | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="fixed32" /> fixed32 | Always four bytes. More efficient than uint32 if values are often greater than 2^28. | uint32 | int | int | uint32 | uint | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="fixed64" /> fixed64 | Always eight bytes. More efficient than uint64 if values are often greater than 2^56. | uint64 | long | int/long | uint64 | ulong | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="sfixed32" /> sfixed32 | Always four bytes. | int32 | int | int | int32 | int | integer | Bignum or Fixnum (as required) |
| <a name="sfixed64" /> sfixed64 | Always eight bytes. | int64 | long | int/long | int64 | long | integer/string | Bignum |
| <a name="bool" /> bool |  | bool | boolean | boolean | bool | bool | boolean | TrueClass/FalseClass |
| <a name="string" /> string | A string must always contain UTF-8 encoded or 7-bit ASCII text. | string | String | str/unicode | string | string | string | String (UTF-8) |
| <a name="bytes" /> bytes | May contain any arbitrary sequence of bytes. | string | ByteString | str | []byte | ByteString | string | String (ASCII-8BIT) |
