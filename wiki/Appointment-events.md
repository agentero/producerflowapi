# Appointment Webhook Events

This document provides comprehensive documentation for webhook events related to license appointments in the ProducerFlow system. Appointment webhooks deliver real-time notifications when appointment statuses change due to processing by NIPR (National Insurance Producer Registry) or direct actions by the tenant admin in Producerflow's portal.

## Overview

ProducerFlow supports two types of carrier integrations for license appointments:

### 1. NIPR Integration (Asynchronous)

For carriers that use NIPR (National Insurance Producer Registry), appointments follow an asynchronous workflow:

1. **Request Submitted**: An appointment request or termination is submitted via the API
2. **Initial Response**: The API returns immediately with `in_progress` status if accepted by NIPR
3. **NIPR Processing**: NIPR processes the request asynchronously (can take minutes to hours)
4. **Webhook Notification**: When NIPR completes processing, ProducerFlow sends a webhook with the final result
5. **Status Updated**: Subsequent API calls return the updated appointment status

### 2. ProducerFlow Direct Integration (Synchronous)

For carriers that use ProducerFlow's direct appointment system, the process is immediate:

1. **Direct Action**: Tenant admin creates or terminates appointments directly in ProducerFlow
2. **Immediate Status**: Appointments are immediately set to `appointed` or `terminated` status
3. **Webhook Notification**: ProducerFlow sends a webhook notification immediately
4. **No Processing Delay**: No waiting for external system processing

## Event Types

### appointment.created

Triggered when a new appointment is created in the system.

**NIPR Integration:**

- After calling `RequestAppointment` RPC and NIPR accepts the request
- The appointment is created with `in_progress` status

**ProducerFlow Direct:**

- When tenant admin creates an appointment directly
- The appointment is immediately set to `appointed` status

### appointment.updated

Triggered when an appointment's processing status changes.

**NIPR Integration:**

- NIPR completes processing of an appointment request (moves from `in_progress` to `appointed` or `rejected`)
- NIPR completes processing of a termination request (moves from `termination_requested` to `terminated`)
- After calling `TerminateAppointment` RPC and NIPR processes the termination. The appointment status changes to `terminated`

**ProducerFlow Direct:**

- Tenant admin manually updates appointment status
- Status changes between `appointed` and `terminated`

## Processing Statuses

Understanding appointment processing statuses is crucial for handling webhook events. Different statuses are available depending on the integration type:

### NIPR Integration Statuses

| Status | Description | Webhook Trigger |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `in_progress` | Appointment request submitted to NIPR, awaiting processing | ✅ `appointment.created` |
| `appointed` | NIPR successfully processed appointment request | ✅ `appointment.updated` |
| `termination_requested` | Termination request submitted to NIPR, awaiting processing | ✅ `appointment.updated` |
| `terminated` | NIPR successfully processed termination request | ✅ `appointment.updated` |
| `rejected` | NIPR rejected the appointment request | ✅ `appointment.updated` |

### ProducerFlow Direct Integration Statuses

| Status | Description | Webhook Trigger |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `appointed` | Appointment created/activated by tenant admin | ✅ `appointment.created` or `appointment.updated` |
| `terminated` | Appointment terminated by tenant admin | ✅ `appointment.updated` |

## Integration Guidelines

### Event Processing

1. **Status-Based Handling**: Handle webhook events based on appointment status:
   - `in_progress` = Only appears in NIPR integration, indicates appointment request processing
   - `appointed` = Final status in both integration types
   - `termination_requested` = Only appears in NIPR integration, indicates termination request processing
   - `terminated` = Final status in both integration types  
   - `rejected` = Only appears in NIPR integration

2. **Idempotency**: Always use the `id` field to handle duplicate webhook deliveries

3. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for failed webhook processing

4. **Validation**: Validate payloads against the [appointment schema](../webhooks/schema/appointment_schema.json)

### Key Differences Between Integration Types

| Aspect | NIPR Integration | ProducerFlow Direct |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Processing** | Asynchronous (minutes to hours) | Immediate |
| **Initial Status** | `in_progress` | `appointed` |
| **Origin Values** | `ProducerFlowPortal`, `ProducerFlowAPI` | `ProducerFlowPortal`, `ProducerFlowAPI` |
| **Possible Rejections** | Yes (`rejected`) | No |
| **Fees** | May include NIPR processing fees | $0 |
| **Webhook Timing** | Delayed until NIPR processes | Immediate |

### Fee Handling

Appointment and termination fees are included in webhook payloads as `fees_in_cents`:

- **NIPR Integration**: Values represent actual NIPR processing fees (e.g., 5000 = $50.00)
- **ProducerFlow Direct**: Typically 0 since no external processing fees apply
- Zero fees indicate no charge was applied

### Error Scenarios

Handle these common error scenarios:

#### NIPR Integration Errors

1. **Rejection Reasons**: Check `appointment_data.reasons` array
   - Common reasons: expired license, missing CE credits, carrier restrictions
   - Use reasons to guide remediation steps

2. **Processing Delays**:
   - NIPR processing can take hours or days for both appointments and terminations
   - Don't treat delayed webhooks as failures
   - Monitor appointment status via API if needed

3. **Termination Processing**: 
   - Status moves from `appointed` → `termination_requested` → `terminated`
   - Handle `termination_requested` status to notify users that termination is pending

#### ProducerFlow Direct Integration

1. **Immediate Processing**: No delays or external processing errors
2. **Admin Actions**: All changes are intentional admin actions
3. **No Rejections**: Direct appointments don't get rejected by external systems

## Related API Methods
